# iWetland

This repository was created in conjuction with the manuscript "iWetland: A community science platform for monitoring wetland water levels" submitted to the journal *Citizen Science: Theory and Practice*.

The repository contains the code and instructions on how to set up the iWetland platform. iWetland is a community science wetland water level monitoring platform developed by the McMaster Ecohydrology Lab and tested in wetlands in the Georgian Bay Biosphere Mnidoo Gamii, a UNESCO Biosphere located in Ontario, Canada. The iWetland platform consists of auto-forwarded SMS text messages using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), Gmail to receive messages, Google Sheets for the water level database, and [Google Scripts](https://script.google.com/home) to data processing.
